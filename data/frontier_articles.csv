This paper proposes an innovative solution to this challenge by applying the Snake Optimization Algorithm (SOA) to a blockchain framework, aimed at enhancing transaction throughput and reducing latency. A thorough literature review contextualizes our work within the current state of blockchain scalability efforts. We introduce a methodology that integrates SOA into the transaction validation process of a blockchain network. The effectiveness of this approach is empirically evaluated by comparing transaction processing times before and after the implementation of SOA. The results show a substantial reduction in latency, with the optimized system achieving lower average transaction times across various transaction volumes. Notably, the latency for processing batches of 10 and 100 transactions decreased from 30.29 ms to 155.66 ms–0.42 ms and 0.37 ms, respectively, post optimization. These findings indicate that SOA is exceptionally efficient in batch transaction scenarios, presenting an inverse scalability behavior that defies typical system performance degradation with increased load. Our research contributes a significant advancement in blockchain scalability, with implications for the development of more efficient and adaptable blockchain systems suitable for high throughput enterprise applications.","","Taher, Shimal S.

The main limitation of such approach lies in its inability to accommodate the diverse legal rights, obligations and assets that blockchain technology can virtually reproduce. Already in 2017–2018 there were attempts to tokenize rights outside of securities law framework, these initiatives served more as makeshift solutions to circumvent securities regulations than as thorough frameworks for managing real-world assets and commercial activities. This article conducts a comparative and historical analysis of blockchain regulatory initiatives in Europe and the US, positing that the regulation of blockchain technology through a securities law lens is driven by reactionary opportunism. Such a basis is deemed inappropriate and insufficient, as securities laws being a field of public law were not designed to govern real-world assets and commerce, which fundamentally rely on the principles of laissez-faire and freedom of contract inherent in private law. A regulatory stance focused solely on public law overlooks the full potential of blockchain technology, and risks stifling innovation and practical applications. To illustrate this, the article presents case study of tokenization of contractual rights demonstrating that securities law-focused legal regulations, such as the EU Regula...","","Kiskis, Mindaugas","Blockchain; crypto; Digital assets; Virtual economy; private law; Contractual rights","article"

Distributed ledgers such as Bitcoin have the ability to record data of any kind alongside the transfer of monetary value. This property can be used to provide a source of immutable, tamper-evident data for a wide variety applications spanning from the supply chain to distributed social media. However, this paradigm also presents new challenges regarding the scalability of data storage protocols, such that the data can be efficiently accessed by a large number of users, in addition to maintaining privacy for data stored on the blockchain. Here, we present a new mechanism for constructing blockchain transactions using Merkle trees comprised of transaction fields. Our construction allows for transaction data to be verified field-wise using Merkle proofs. We show how the technique can be implemented either at the system level or as a second layer protocol that does not require changes to the underlying blockchain. This technique allows users to efficiently verify blockchain data by separately checking targeted individual data items stored in transactions. Furthermore, we outline how our protocol can afford users improved privacy in a blockchain context by enabling network-wide data redaction. This feature of our design can be used by blockchain nodes to facilitate easier compliance with regulations such as GDPR and the r...","","Davies, Jack","Blockchain; Scalability; Privacy; Efficiency; networks; Data; redaction; Compliance","article"

The fact that there are already over 6,000 cryptocurrencies in use worldwide because of this, investors with regular incomes put money into promising cryptocurrencies that have low market values. Accurate pricing forecasting is necessary to build profitable trading strategies because of the unique characteristics and volatility of cryptocurrencies. For consistent forecasting accuracy in an unknown price range, a variation point detection technique is employed. Due to its bidirectional nature, a Bi-LSTM appropriate for recording long-term dependencies in data that is sequential. Accurate forecasting in the cryptocurrency space depends on identifying these connections, since values are subject to change over time due to a variety of causes. In this work, we employ four deep learning-based models that are LSTM, FB-Prophet, LSTM-GRU and Bidirectional-LSTM(Bi-LSTM) and these four models are compared with Silverkite. Silverkite is the main algorithm of the Python library Graykite by LinkedIn. Using historical bitcoin data from 2012 to 2021, we utilized to analyse the models' mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE). The Bi-LSTM model performs better than others, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.633 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.815. The conclusion has significant ramifications for bitcoin investors and industry experts.","","Tripathy, Nrusingha","cryptocurrency; LSTM; Fb-prophet; LSTM-GRU; Silverkite; Bidirectional-LSTM; Forecasting; Time series analysis FIGURE 1 Greykite's principal forecasting algorithm's architecture diagram: Silverkite","article"

They compete broadly in two main ways: proof of work effort to win blocks; and transaction processing to gather fee rewards into the blocks they win. This paper contributes to existing literature by developing a dynamic model that separates these two functions, and explores implications for aggregate efficiency outcomes. Specifically, when set by free market forces (unrestricted by artificially imposed block size caps), what happens to overall transaction prices and quantities relative to total energy use? When is it worth Stackelberg-leading miners investing in efficiency-improving R&D? What effect does this have on overall efficiency over time? By explicitly separating specialised capital dedicated to SHA256 hashing (for proof of work) from transaction processing capital (for transaction collection and verification), this paper sheds light on these questions. One key conclusion is that miner innovation lowers energy use per transaction over time for elastic enough transaction demand schedules. The more competitors Bitcoin has (existing fiat and data services, and other new Blockchain-based systems), the stronger is this conclusion.","","Rogers, Jack R.","bitcoin; equilibrium; Stackelberg; Energy effi ciency; Transaction fees","article"

"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2023.1276233","Smart contract life-cycle management: an engineering framework for the generation of robust and verifiable smart contracts","The concept of smart contracts (SCs) is becoming more prevalent, and their application is gaining traction across many diverse scenarios. However, producing poorly constructed contracts carries significant risks, including the potential for substantial financial loss, a lack of trust in the technology, and the risk of exposure to cyber-attacks. Several tools exist to assist in developing SCs, but their limited functionality increases development complexity. Expert knowledge is required to ensure contract reliability, resilience, and scalability. To overcome these risks and challenges, tools and services based on modeling and formal techniques are required that offer a robust methodology for SC verification and life-cycle management. This study proposes an engineering framework for the generation of a robust and verifiable smart contract (GRV-SC) framework that covers the entire SC life-cycle from design to deployment stages. It adopts SC modeling and automated formal verification methodologies to detect security vulnerabilities and improve resilience, extensibility, and code optimization to mitigate risks associated with SC development. Initially, the framework includes the implementation of a formal approach, using colored Petri nets (CPNs), to model cross-platform Digital Asset Modeling Language (DAML) SCs. It also incorporates a specialized type safety dynamic verifier, which is designed to detect and address new vulnerabilities that can arise in DAML contracts, such as...","","Mustafa, Iqra","Formal Verification; Smart contracts; Model-driven engineering; Knowledge Base Graphs; DAML Model","article"

This situation is harmful for overcoming problems where collective action is needed, such as for governing digital commons. Organisations that run on collectively owned decentralised infrastructure are able to overcome this centralisation of power. These common decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs) could help in fostering digitally enabled collective action. However, currently we have no clear view of how a DAO designed for commons governance would operate and be governed. By creating a conceptual prototype of a DAO governing a common, we provide a clear path of how common DAOs should mature and which tools are needed to create them. In this research, we created a governance framework for common DAOs by combining 16 works on technology for commons governance. The framework reveals that common DAO governance consists of three areas: 1) Governance structure, 2) Enabling technology, and 3) Community governance. We provide governance mechanisms that together describe an implementation of Ostrom’s common governance principles in a DAO. This work is a synthesis of previous research on technology for collective action. The proposed framework aids in standardising DAO governance for the common good and may contribute to a large scale roll-out of commons DAOs.","","Van Vulpen, Paul","Decentralized autonomous organization; Blockchain; Smart contracts; Commons governance; Ostrom; constitution; Blockchain governance","article"

Since the launch of the first decentralized justice platform in 2018, the field has attracted wide interest both from practitioners and academics in Web3 and dispute resolution. The decentralized justice approach is based on the ideas of decentralization, economic incentives and a claim to fairness in its decisions. At the current stage of development, decentralized justice is facing a number of technical, market, legal and ethical challenges for further development. This paper provides a review of the short history of decentralized justice, addresses a number of recurrent topics and lays down a path for future exploration.","","Ast, Federico","decentralized justice; Law; Blockchain; arbitration; Dispute resolution; Access to justice; smart contracts.

However, analyzing these networks remains challenging due to the sheer volume and complexity of the data. We introduce a method named InnerCore that detects market manipulators within blockchain-based networks and offers a sentiment indicator for these networks. This is achieved through data depth-based core decomposition and centered motif discovery, ensuring scalability. InnerCore is a computationally efficient, unsupervised approach suitable for analyzing large temporal graphs. We demonstrate its effectiveness by analyzing and detecting three recent real-world incidents from our datasets: the catastrophic collapse of LunaTerra, the Proof-of-Stake switch of Ethereum, and the temporary peg loss of USDC–while also verifying our results against external ground truth. Our experiments show that InnerCore can match the qualified analysis accurately without human involvement, automating blockchain analysis in a scalable manner, while being more effective and efficient than baselines and state-of-the-art attributed change detection approach in dynamic graphs.","","Zhu, Jason","BLOCKCHAIN NETWORKS; Decentralized finance; Stablecoin; Data depth; Core decomposition; motifs","article"

The paper proposes a formal analysis framework for wealth distribution analysis and simulation of interactions between economic participants in an economy. Using this framework, we define a mechanism for identifying prices that achieve the desired wealth distribution according to some metric, and stability of economic dynamics. The motivation to study tokenomics theory is the increasing use of tokenization, specifically in financial infrastructures, where designing token economies is in the forefront. Tokenomics theory establishes a quantitative framework for wealth distribution amongst economic participants and implements the algorithmic regulatory controls mechanism that reacts to changes in economic conditions. In our framework, we introduce a concept of tokenomic taxonomy where agents in the economy are categorized into agent types and interactions between them. This novel approach is motivated by having a generalized model of the macroeconomy with controls being implemented through interactions and policies. The existence of such controls allows us to measure and readjust the wealth dynamics in the economy to suit the desired objectives.","","Sadykhov, R.","Detect; Blockchain; Blockchain Economics; tokenomics; Token Economy; Control Theory in Macroeconomics; Wealth distribution; Economy Simulation","article"
